\section{Introduction}
Malaria is a serious and at times fatal epidemic affecting almost one out of every 2nd person in the entire world. Worldwide, malaria ranks 5th as the leading cause of death from infectious diseases, whereas if taken Africa, it is more dangerous there as it is the 2nd leading cause there. In the United States, thousands of new cases of malaria occur each year, which mainly include travelers or immigrants. In 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated 140 - 280 million cases of malaria occurred, with approximately around 650, 000 deaths. Malaria comes under the category of parasitic diseases which is transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito or by blood transfusion (surgery, needle sharing, birth). 

\paragraph{}

There are 4 different species that cause malaria in humans: Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae. Of the four, P. falciparum and P. vivax are the most common while P. falciparum is the most fatal. In humans, the parasite first gets multiplied in the liver and then starts infecting the red blood cells. Once the parasites reach the blood system, symptoms such as high fever, and vomiting start occurring, usually within 2 weeks after the mosquito bite. Also, once the parasites reach the human blood cells, the female Anopheles mosquito can become infected by taking a blood meal. It is important to note that the Anopheles mosquito feeds between dusk and dawn, often inside.

Mathematical models have always been used to provide an accurate structure for understanding malaria transmission dynamics for over a century in humans. One of the earliest mathematical models for understanding malaria transmission was developed by Ross (Koutou et al., 2018; Moulay, Aziz-Alaoui, & Cadivel, 2011).

\paragraph{}

Ross’s model consisted of two nonlinear differential equations in two state
variables that correspond to the proportions of infected human beings and the
infected mosquitoes. Macdonald (1957) then improved Ross’s more famous
differential equations model by including some biological assumptions andrelevant entomological field data, which made it more accurate than before.
Since then, multiple models have been proposed for malaria by various authors.
For instance, Aron and May (Chitnis, Hyman, & Cushing, 2008; Khan, Khan, &
Islam, 2015; Traoré et al., 2018) added various features of malaria to the existing
models, such as including a period of immunity in human beings.

\paragraph{}

The inclusion of acquired immunity proposed by (Chitnis, Cushing, & Hyman,
2006; Ruan, Xiao, & Beier, 2008) was one of the major points of malaria
modeling. With the disease still thriving and threatening to be a major source of
death and disability due to changed environmental and socio-economic
conditions, it is necessary to make a critical assessment of the models already
there and study the changes brought over time.

\paragraph{}

We have tried to employ mathematical modeling to address biological issues and address
questions on the transmission of malaria. For this project, we start using the standard
epidemiological ODE Susceptible - Infected - Recovered- Susceptible (SIRS) model.
In the SIRS model, different fractions of the population are classified as Susceptible to
infection, S(t), Infected, I(t), or Recovered from infection, R(t), where t represents time. The
size of each group can change based on different parameters and the current values of S(t),
I(t), and R(t), the total population is not taken to be constant, rather birth and death rates are
also taken into consideration to get more precise information.

\paragraph{}

The SIRS model is a simple model useful for modeling other diseases too such as chicken
pox and influenza. Modern epidemiology ODE models are based on these same SIRS
concepts of populations flowing between the different stages. For our model, we will apply
the basic concepts of the SIRS model, taking into consideration all the variables.

\paragraph{}

The remaining part of the paper is structured as follows. The next section concerns the
model formulation. In this Section, we have also presented some useful preliminaries and
assumptions for the mathematical analysis of the model. In further sections, we have
derived some results about equilibriums. The global stability of the equilibriums was
checked, and the results are then subjected to different graphical interpretations. We then
conclude the paper with some remarks of our own.
\section{Model}
In constructing the model we employ natural behaviour of the infection. The population
divided into three mutually exclusive exhaustive classes namely, susceptible population(S),
infected population (I) and Recovered population (R). These classes of population interact
with each other on the basis of behaviour of infection.
Malaria being an endemic disease the rate of spread of the infection is directly proportional
to the susceptible population and the population that is already infected giving rise to βSI
term in (i) and (ii). The rate at which people recover ( gain partial immunity) is directly
proportional only to the size of population infected, giving rise to δ​ 2​ I term in equation (ii) and
(iii). The rate of loss of partial immunity and again becoming susceptible depends solely on
size recovered population, giving rise to rR term in equation (iii) and (i) .
Individuals are born in healthy state i.e in susceptible population with rate of A。. Rate of
natural death is directly proportional to the size of population and rate of deaths due to
infection is directly proportional to infected population.

 \section{Stability Analysis} 
\subsection{ Local Stability Analysis}

\paragraph{}For this purpose we will calculate Jacobian matrix and then calculate the eigen values at that point and determine the  sufficient conditions in which the eigen value obtained will have negative real part and if we succeed in doing so then we will say that it is local asympototically stable . 

\paragraph{}The general variational matrix is given by 

\[M = \left[\begin{matrix}-\beta (I)-\delta_{0}&  -\beta (S)& r \\\beta (I) & \beta(S)-\delta_{0}-\delta_{1}-\delta_{2}& 0 \\0 &\delta_{2} & - \delta_0-r \end{matrix}\right].\]

\subsubsection{Stability of disease-free equilibrium} On substituting 
\[S = \dfrac{A_0}{\delta_0}, I = 0, R = 0\]
into the general variational matrix M, we get
\[M = \left[\begin{matrix}- \delta_{0} &- \beta(\dfrac{A_0}{\delta_0}) & r \\0  & \beta(\dfrac{A_0}{\delta_0})-\delta_{0}-\delta_{1}-\delta_{2} & 0\\0 & \delta_2}  &-\delta_{0}-r \end{matrix}\right].\]
