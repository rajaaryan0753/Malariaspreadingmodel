# Malaria spreading model
<br>Octave and LaTex are used while doing the project.</br>
<en> Aim of the project -</en>
<br> To understand the Process of spreading of Malaria. So that major factor controlling it's sepreading can come in the picture</br>

<en> How we are doing that </en>
<br>We will use the Basic concepts of Ordinary differential equation and Graphical plotting for  better demonstration of fact and this will help us to reach a mathematical model for controlling the situation of Malaria</br>
